# mConnect
*No longer being maintained*
*If looking for something similar, there are pluggins*
## Overview
Due to the policy of only including anime and manga of Japanese origin, one could not keep track of their manhwa or manhua using MyAnimeList. mConnect strives to solve this issue by serving as a centralized with a few extra bells and whistles.

Any updates on mConnect will update in all linked accounts. At the moment mConnect can sync:
 - [**MyAnimeList**](https://myanimelist.net/)
 - [**Mangadex**](https://mangadex.org/)

Another feature is the latest news from the [Anime News Network](https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/). The news is provided by a RSS feed.


 ## Technologies
 mConnect's backend is written in [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) and is fairly simple to run. The frontend is written in pure HTML/CSS/JS with some styling elements [bootstrapped](https://getbootstrap.com/). Currently using [MyAnimeList](https://myanimelist.net/apiconfig/references/api/v2) and [MangaDex](https://api.mangadex.org/docs.html) APIs.
 
### Running mConnect
To run mConnect on a local server, you will need to create a local database in [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) named `mConnect`.  Moreover, you will need to have a [virtual environment](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-virtual-environment/#:~:text=A%20virtual%20environment%20is%20a,of%20the%20Python%20developers%20use.) running before the migrations. After cloning the repository, you'll need to migrate the models into your local database using 
```bash
// Inside .../mConnect/mConnect
py manage.py makemigrations
py manage.py migrate
```
After, to start the local server you will use
```bash
py manage.py runserver
```

## Scheduled features and Future Plans
- **Recommender System** - Having a centralized list of interests makes it really easy to obtain data
- **Displaying Extra Stats** - Stats may include preferred genre, tags, scoring trends, and other details generated by the recommender system
- **Notifications on Chapter and Episode releases** - A small easy feature but will most likely be bundled with a larger update.
